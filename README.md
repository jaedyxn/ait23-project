## Abstract
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components of a smart grid, consisting of smart meters that monitor the
power usage as well as communicate and control energy usage. Smart meters also introduce numerous new methods of electricity theft.
Malicious users are presented with the novel opportunity to hack into smart meters by way of advanced instruments or cyberattack
techniques. This illegal practice causes a vast amount of financial loss every year. Our objective is to exploit deep learning
techniques to analyze the load profiles and electricity consumption patterns of users we are able to identify malicious energy users
committing energy theft and reporting fraudulent meter readings. 

We are using an electricity consumption dataset released by State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) which contains the electricity consumption data of 42,372 electricity customers within 1,035 days (1, 2014 to October 31, 2016).
